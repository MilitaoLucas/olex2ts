# Olex2TS -- Olex2 Tree-sitter parser
This project aims to at first improve color highlighting of Olex2-gui htm files. Maybe in the future, it could also 
implement linting and other useful functionality. Every contribution is welcome!

This is a fork from [tree-sitter-html](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-html/). This project is heavily based
on theirs, so thank you!

## Instalation
For now, this is not ready. I have an MVP, but I would not trust it. If you want to install it anyway, I will only
provide minimum instructions:
### Requirements:
- Node
- GCC/G++

### Instructions
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/MilitaoLucas/olex2ts
cd olex2ts
node install
```
After this, you should be capable of installing with `TSInstall olex2htm` inside Neovim.

## Objectives
1. Get color highlighting working for every Olex2 htm component
2. Fix every bug that appears
3. Create linting functionality
4. Create LSP functionalities
